👋 Hi, I’m @ditto249

I’m a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Essex, passionate about cybersecurity, networking, and building secure systems. I hold CCNA1 & CCNA2 certifications and have hands-on experience across both offensive and defensive security projects.

🔐 Cybersecurity Projects
🏠 Cybersecurity Homelab (Enterprise 101)

Built an enterprise-style lab environment simulating a business network with Windows AD, Ubuntu servers, and Linux/Windows clients.

Practiced offensive techniques using Hydra, Evil-WinRM, NetExec, SecLists, and XFreeRDP.

Developed defensive skills with Wazuh SIEM, Security Onion, and MailHog for phishing simulations.

Gained real-world experience in system administration, penetration testing, and incident detection/response.

🌐 Web Server Hardening & Attack Simulation

Hardened an Apache server with ModSecurity WAF and Fail2Ban, mitigating brute-force and injection attacks.

Simulated SQL injection and directory brute-force attacks with Kali Linux.

Tuned defences through log analysis, reducing false positives and strengthening detection.

📊 Monitoring & Alerting Stack

Deployed a monitoring stack with Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager.

Configured Node Exporter for system metrics and created custom alert rules.

Validated the system by stress-testing and routing alerts via email.

🌍 Beyond Cybersecurity

Vice-President, TEDxUniversityofEssex — leading event planning and technical operations.

Session Leader, Clothes Exchange — contributed 100+ volunteer hours promoting sustainable fashion.

Part-time at MFG Felixstowe — balancing academics, volunteering, and work with technical growth.

🚀 Interests & Goals

I’m driven by curiosity and problem-solving — always exploring how systems break and how to defend them.
My current focus is on:

Ethical hacking & penetration testing

SIEM & incident response

Enterprise-level system administration

Network security
